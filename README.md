# FTP-Messenger
The world's first messenger that works on the protocol FTP.

In fact, FTP is not intended for sending messages. But this will not prevent this idea from being realized.

There are two versions of this messenger: Simple and Pro. Both versions have their pros and cons.

FTP Messenger Simple
- Uses less ROM
- Works on Python or JS
- No interface (console is used as interface)
